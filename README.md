## Introduction (WIP)

This is a mini-project I created in 2023. I decided to showcase it on this profile as a way of showing that mini-projects from 2025 are not the only ones I have ever done. There are more of these mini-projects on my old GitHub profile, although they are not as good as these new ones when compared to each other.

However, I decided that this curated version of a project based on Lionel Messi's injury record was the most presentable out of the old guard. If you would like to see what this project looked like before curation, you can do that by clicking on the following link: [Messi Injuries Unedited](https://github.com/jakov1002/messi_injuries_Python_SQL_HTML)

For this curated version, I made the project more presentable and removed unnecessary content. I haven't updated the data.
