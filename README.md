## Introduction (WIP)

This is a mini-project I created in 2023. I decided to showcase it on this profile as a way of showing that mini-projects from 2025 are not the only ones I have ever done. 

This is an edited version of the old project. I made the project more presentable and removed unnecessary content. I have not performed data edits.

## The Dataset
I used Lionel Messi's injury record on Transfermarkt up to the year 2023. I got the data by building a scraper.

## Tools I Used
Python
HTML (for accessing the webpage elements with data)
Jupyter Notebook
