## Introduction
I created this mini-project in 2023 and decided to upload it to this profile to show that the mini-projects from 2025 are not the only ones I have done. 

This is an edited version of the original project. I added clear explanations and removed unnecessary content. I have not performed any data edits, updates, or changed the code.

The code, outputs, and insights can be found within the .ipynb file. 

Click the links in the section below to access whichever iteration of the project you would like to view.

## Links
The link for the new version will take you to the .ipynb file within this project. The link for the old version will take you to my old profile and the project's README page.

New version: [Messi Injuries Edited 2025 version](https://github.com/jakov1003/2023_messi_injuries_Python_HTML/blob/main/messi_injuries.ipynb)

Old version: [Messi Injuries Unedited 2023 version](https://github.com/jakov1002/messi_injuries_Python_SQL_HTML)


## The Dataset
I used Lionel Messi's injury record from Transfermarkt up to the year I made this project (2023). I obtained the data by building a scraper in Python.

## Tools I Used
- Python
- HTML (for accessing the webpage elements containing data)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Why this one?
I selected this project because I found it to be the most presentable among all my older projects, especially after curating it.
